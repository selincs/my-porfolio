<p>I'm currently a second year student at Suffolk County Community College in the Computer Science program. I took an interest in Computer Science
  after having spent most of my adolsecent life growing up on the Internet. Art, music, video games, music, social media: so many of my interests and hobbies
  in this world are enabled by things I couldn't understand, and I wanted to change that. I love learning new things, and the field of Computer Science
  at first was initially a terrifying prospect to a former Arts and English Languages student who found I thrived in most courses but had carefully 
  avoided math most of her life.</p>
   
  <p>Honestly speaking, I wasn't sure I'd be a good fit for this type of coursework at first. I avoided math in High School and my first time in College
   because I found it difficult and I had only found hardship and frustration. But out of desire to challenge myself in returning to school, and build a
   better life for myself going forward, unafraid of tackling challenges. I began in Precalculus. Through patience and perseverance, I overcame my 
   aversion to math, and found myself more curious with each class I took, as it explains so much of how not just Computer Science works, but the world 
   we live in as well. 
  </p>

  <p>Having overcome my fear of math, learned about object-oriented programming and tight-coupling, I found myself suddenly interested
   by the enormous world of walls of text that I had once seen as insurmountable alphabet soup. Every Programming class brought new challenges
   to myself, and I learned to not fear challenge, but to work hard through it and persevere further. There is no loss in failure, only in my
   fear of it! My next projects will be learning Javascript, more HTML and CSS, distancing myself from tight-coupling in my codework, and 
   understanding coding Design Patterns.
