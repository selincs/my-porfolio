<p>Hi there! I'm Selin, a recent graduate of Suffolk County Community College's Computer Science program. I took an interest in Computer Science
  after having spent most of my adolsecent life growing up on the Internet. Art, music, video games, social media--so many of my interests 
  and hobbies in this world are enabled by things I couldn't understand, and I wanted to change that. I love learning new things, and the field 
  of Computer Science was initially a terrifying prospect to the version of myself who had graduated from SUNY New Paltz with degrees in Theatre Arts and 
  English.</p>

  <p>Having overcome my fear of math, learned about object-oriented programming and tight-coupling, and discovered a curiousity to learn more, I found 
    myself suddenly interested by the enormous world made of walls of text that I had once seen as insurmountable alphabet soup. Every programming class 
    brought new challenges to myself, and I learned to not fear challenge, but to work hard through it and persevere further. There is no loss in failure, only in my
   fear of it! My next projects will be learning Javascript, more HTML and CSS, distancing myself from tight-coupling in my codework, and 
   understanding coding Design Patterns.
  </p>
